# Chai

Chai is a benchmark suite of Collaborative Heterogeneous Applications for Integrated-architectures. The Chai benchmarks are designed to use the latest features of heterogeneous architectures such as shared virtual memory and system-wide atomics to achieve efficient simultaneous collaboration between host and accelerator devices.

Each benchmark has multiple implementations. This release includes the OpenCL 2.0 and OpenCL 1.2 implementations. The CUDA, CUDA-Sim, and C++AMP implementations are underway. If you would like early access to premature versions, please contact us.
